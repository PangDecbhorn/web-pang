            About me
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            I believe in long-term development through continuous learning. From
            no tech background to frontend and data, Iâ€™m growing with every
            project.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            I believe that work is a complement in my life not a punishment, So
            I will keep working throughout my life and learning, find meaning
            life
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            My hobby is studying a book, coding, sometime I tired for work, Just
            drive round my home and have a coffee
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            I worked at Betago as a Data Analyst in the IT team. I made data
            flow plans, created dashboards, and wrote views in SQL. I also
            helped create reports when the team needed them. This job helped me
            understand how to use data in real work. Now, I work at Sleek EV, a
            startup company. I work as a Data Analyst and also help with
            frontend development. I take care of the admin website and the
            company website. I started learning frontend about 6 months ago.
